This Project is possibly not best labeled as a Space Shooter. It is, a Top Down shooting game, set in space. 
The idea I have for this game is to make it a 'Bullet Hell' type game.
It is my month 3 project for 1 Game a Month, it is most likely going to be called
"Space Rogues" idea being that some Space Rogues have boarded your ship and are hijacking the ship.
You have to fight your way to the bridge, to try and regain control.
The Project is open source, it may not be the best written, but anyone can feel free to use the
code in any project.
